 <i>GrimmaFloodfighters</i> is a real-time strategy game that demonstrates the successful integration of open geodata for disaster simulation. The city model in the game is based on publicly available geodata for the Saxony city of Grimma, where players can use floodfighter units, sandbags, boats, and emergency vehicles to rescue people and combat flood-related effects. The city model provides real-time thematic information to the emergency forces, making it a useful tool for disaster preparedness training.

 >  While managing all their units, the water level gradually rises in phases. Over a period of 20 minutes, the water rises four times until it covers approximately 80% of the playable area for the last 4 minutes. Every time the water level rises, 10 events are created at random positions within the playable area.

 > Boats, which have less maneuverable space at the beginning of the game, become much more useful at the end. It's the opposite for cars.
